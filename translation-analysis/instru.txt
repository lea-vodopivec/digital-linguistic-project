data interpretation
data analysis: of all 3 layers and combination of layers (to see if we find some pattern here)

classical descriptive statistics for each of the layer (first the whole average and then separate for LLMs and MTs)
and combination of the layers (if it conveys the meaning + the type 1-4)
also look at the sentences that are translated wrong, but the idiom is translated correct (red cells)
visualization of the data: graphs and report in new file

comparing LLMs and MTs + data for each individual system







Data Analysis and Visualization for Translation Study
Overview
This analysis examines 40 English idioms translated by 4 systems: 2 Machine Translation systems (DeepL, Google Translate) and 2 LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT). Each idiom has 10 example sentences (400 total translations per system).

Data Structure
40 idioms × 10 sentences = 400 translations per system
4 systems: DeepL, Google Translate (MT) | Gemini, ChatGPT (LLM)
3 evaluation layers:
Meaning (Layer 1): yes/no - does translation convey the idiom's meaning
Type (Layer 2): Translation strategy used (1=literal, 2=semantically accurate, 3=cultural equivalence, 4=other)
Red cells (Layer 3): Cases where idiom is correct but sentence is wrong
Proposed Analysis
1. Data Preprocessing
Parse the ODS file and restructure into analysis-ready format
Handle edge cases (yes?, no?, missing values)
Identify "red cells" from color formatting or notation
2. Descriptive Statistics for Each Layer
Layer 1: Meaning Conveyance (yes/no)
Overall accuracy rate per system
Accuracy rate: MT systems vs LLM systems
Per-idiom success rates
Layer 2: Translation Type Distribution (1-4)
Type distribution per system
Type 1 (literal) | Type 2 (paraphrase) | Type 3 (cultural) | Type 4 (other)
Compare MT vs LLM preferences for each type
Layer 3: Red Cells Analysis
Identify sentences where idiom correct but sentence wrong
Count and patterns across systems
3. Combination Analysis
Cross-tabulate: Meaning (yes/no) × Type (1-4)
Pattern discovery: Which types correlate with correct meaning?
System comparison on combined metrics
4. Visualizations
Bar charts: Success rates per system
Grouped bar charts: MT vs LLM comparison
Heatmaps: Type distribution per idiom/system
Stacked bar charts: Type breakdown
Summary tables with confidence intervals
5. Individual System Analysis
Detailed breakdown for each of the 4 systems
Strengths and weaknesses per system
